- Ships are randomly placed (5 ships: Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer)
- Players take turns firing shots
- Hit = red square with explosion emoji
- Miss = gray square with water drop emoji
- Game ends when one player sinks all opponent's ships

## Database Schema

The app uses a single `game_sessions` table with the following structure:

- `id`: Unique session identifier
- `game_type`: Type of game (currently 'battleship')
- `status`: 'waiting', 'active', or 'finished'
- `current_player`: Which player's turn it is (1 or 2)
- `player1_board` / `player2_board`: JSON stringified game boards
- `player1_ships` / `player2_ships`: JSON stringified ship positions
- `moves`: JSON array of all moves made
- `winner`: Player number who won (1 or 2)
